# SFP

#### The app that never lets you AFK

##### An acronym of "Skype for Procrastination", SFP is a small Kotlin app that sends keyboard input at a user-selected period of time without disrupting your typing and never letting the "Away" status to settle in

##### SFP also provides a pseudo screen locker to block your pet from sending random messages to your boss (been there)
